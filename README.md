# PetPickr

Welcome to PetPickr! This app was created in about three weeks, as the final project for the Eleven Fifty Academy software development boot camp. 

With PetPickr, you can find adoptable pets that fit your family, then get the name, phone number and address of the shelter they're located at. Animal shelters can also log in and add adoptable cats and dogs to the registry. 

## Current Features

Here are a few of the features currently available with PetPickr:

* User authentication
  * Different views/options depending on the role of the user(Admin, Shelter or Customer)
* Shelters can add dogs or cats to the registry
  * They input the animal's name, weight, sex, age and price, then include a link to a photo.
* Customers can sort the directory alphabetically by the pet's name, or numerically by the price.
* When a customer finds a pet they like, they can click to get more information, and be taken to the details page of the shelter where the animal currently is.

## Next Steps

After I graduate from EFA, I will be adding functionality to the app, such as: 

* Integration with GoogleMaps and PetFinder APIs
  * PetFinder's API will allow the app to display animals currently up for adoption, while Google Maps' will display the location of the shelter
* Better photo display through CSS
* More specific differential between the shelter account and its animals
